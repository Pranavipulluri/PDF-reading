# ðŸ“„ PDF Heading Detection & Structuring Pipeline

Our solution to 1A extracts structured outlines (Title + H1/H2/H3 headings) from PDF documents using cutting-edge AI techniques. It combines rule-based engines, machine learning classification, advanced layout analysis, and semantic NLP to achieve maximum accuracy across diverse document types.

##  Phase 1: PDF Ingestion & Text Extraction
###  What Happens Here

* *Primary Extraction (PyMuPDF)*: Fast and efficient for most PDFs.
* *Quality Check*: Validates extracted content.
* *Fallback Extraction (pdfplumber)*: More thorough, used if needed.
* *Intelligent Merging*: Combines best results for optimal quality.

###  Each Text Block Contains:

*  *Text content* - The actual words.
*  *Font info* - Name, size, weight, style.
*  *Position data* - X/Y coordinates.
*  *Page metadata* - Page number, layout, etc.

---

##  Phase 2: Font Analysis & Visual Clustering
###  Why This Works

* Documents use *visual hierarchy* for structure.
* *KMeans* finds visually distinct groups.
* *No hardcoded thresholds* â€” adapts to each document.
* Includes *position awareness* for vertical order.

---

##  Phase 3: Pattern Recognition Engine
###  Pattern Intelligence

* 15+ supported numbering schemes (1., I., A., etc.)
* *Multilingual support* (Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, etc.)
* Understands *hierarchy levels* (1.1 under 1.0)
* Avoids *false positives* via context analysis

---

##  Phase 4: Semantic NLP Analysis
###  NLP Intelligence Features

*  *Language detection*: Auto-detects language
*  *Keyword analysis*: Identifies structural words like "Introduction"
*  *Title case analysis*: Headings use Title Case
*  *Structural understanding*: Headings â‰  full sentences
*  *Cross-lingual support*: Works in 8+ languages

---

##  Phase 5: Context Tracking & Hierarchy Validation
###  Context Intelligence

*  *Hierarchy validation* (H1 â†’ H2 â†’ H3)
*  *Gap detection* (detects missing levels)
*  *Auto-correction* of hierarchy issues
*  *Format-awareness* (adapts to academic/technical layouts)

---

##  Phase 6: Ensemble Decision Making
###  Ensemble Intelligence

*  *Weighted voting* across detection strategies
*  *Consensus bonus* when methods agree
*  *Multi-evidence synthesis* for better precision
*  *Adaptive thresholds* per document

##  Final Output

A structured document representation:

json
[
  {
    "metadata": {
      "detected_language": "english",
      "total_blocks_analyzed": 10
    },
    "outline": [
      {
        "text": "1. Introduction",
        "level": "H1"
        "page": 1
      }
    ],
    "title": "Title"
  }
]
